Erlang library that simply generates a random string.

It has one function get.

Two parameters:
-  the length of the string
-  the list of string characters from which to randomly choose

This library has been packaged with rebar.

So you can use randomstring from any instance of the Erlang console by installing in the erlang library directory.

This is usually found in :
/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib

Once you have moved the randomstring directory into the Erlang library folder, compile it with rebar:

$ ./rebar compile

And voila!  You can use randomstring from Erlang console in the following way:

>  randomstring:get(5, "1234567890qwertyuiop").
>  8j5dp
